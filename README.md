# About
ntfy-toast _(also known as Node-Toasted)_, is a command line application capable of creating Windows Toast notifications on Windows 8 or later.  This app is part of a family of applications called `Ntfy` or Notify.

<br />


## What is ntfy?
[ntfy.sh](https://ntfy/) (pronounced "notify") is a simple HTTP-based pub-sub notification service. With ntfy, you can send notifications to your phone or desktop via scripts from any computer, without having to sign up or pay any fees. If you'd like to run your own instance of the service, you can easily do so since ntfy is open source.

</div>

<br />

## What is ntfy-desktop
[ntfy-desktop](https://github.com/Aetherinox/ntfy-desktop) allows you to access the official free / paid notification service [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh/), or your own self-hosted version of ntfy from within a desktop application which utilizes Electron as the wrapper.

This version of ntfy-desktop is based on the package ntfy-electron created by xdpirate, however, this version brings some changes in functionality, as well as some additional edits that I personally needed.

## What is ntfy-toast
[ntfy-toast](https://github.com/Aetherinox/ntfy-toast) _(the app in this repo)_ is a notification system for Windows 10/11 which is used within [ntfy-desktop](https://github.com/Aetherinox/ntfy-desktop) to display notifications for users.

It is based on [SnoreToast](https://github.com/KDE/snoretoast), but has been updated with numerous features.

<br />

---

<br />

# Features
- Single binary file which works with x32 and x64 bit operating systems
- New `-persistent` option which allows a notification to stay on a user's screen indefinitely until the user closes it.
- Many small bug fixes

<br />

---

<br />

# Usage
When using the command-line to show notifications, you can push a notification by opening Command Prompt and running:

```shell
cd X:\path\to\ntfytoast
```

<br />

Then push a notification with:
```shell ignore
ntfytoast.exe -t "Title" -m "Message"
```

<br />

To make a notification stay on screen until the user dismisses it, add `-persistent`.
```shell ignore
ntfytoast.exe -t "Title" -m "Message" -persistent
```

<br />

To make a notifiation stay on-screen for `25 seconds`, use `-d long`
```shell ignore
ntfytoast.exe -t "Title" -m "Message" -d long
```

<br />

To make a notifiation stay on-screen for `7 seconds`, use `-d short`
```shell ignore
ntfytoast.exe -t "Title" -m "Message" -d short
```

<br />

Other available options are listed below within the section [CLI Arguments](#cli-arguments).

<br />

## Customizing App Name
Windows Toast notifications will show the name of the application calling the notification at the top of each popup. Out-of-box, the application name will be NtfyToast.

If you wish to brand notifications with your own application name, then there are a few steps you must complete.

<br />

### Create App Shortcut
You must create a windows shortcut (.lnk) within your windows Start Menu. This is a requirement by Microsoft.

NtfyToast includes a command which will help you create the shortcut link automatically. To do this, open Command Prompt and run the command:

```shell
ntfytoast.exe -install "MyApp\MyApp.lnk" "C:\path\to\myApp.exe" "My.APP_ID"
```

<br />

| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `"MyApp\MyApp.lnk"` | Where the lnk shortcut will be placed.  <br /> <br /> `C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\MyApp\MyApp.lnk` |
| `"C:\path\to\myApp.exe"` | Path to the executable you want to show the name for at the top of notifications |
| `"My.APP_ID"` | Your .exe app id |

<br />

To get the appID for the application you want to use, you can open Powershell and run the command:

```powershell
get-StartApps | Where-Object {$_.Name -like '*YourAppName*'}
```

<br />

In our example, we can run
```powershell
get-StartApps | Where-Object {$_.Name -like '*Ntfytoast*'}
```

<br />

Which returns the following:
```console
Name      AppID
----      -----
ntfytoast com.ntfytoast.id
```

<br />

This means that if I wanted to use NtfyToast as the app which sends notifications, my final command would be:

```
ntfytoast.exe -install "Ntfytoast\Ntfytoast.lnk" "C:\path\to\ntfytoast.exe" "com.ntfytoast.id"
```

<br />

When the `.lnk` is created, it will be placed in:
```
C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs
```

<br />

</div>


<br />

### Call App
Now that you have your app shortcut created, you can simply call the app every time you want to send a notification using `-appID`. Remember to use your own app's id.

```
ntfytoast.exe -t "Notification" -m "This is a test message" -appID "com.ntfytoast.id"
```

<br />

If you do not specify `-appID <your.app.id>`, then NtfyToast will be used as the default.

# Build
These instructions are only for people who wish to make changes to the NtfyToast source code / commit changes to the repo via pull requests. If you have no interest in editing the source code, then you can skip this section.

<br />

The easiest way to build this package is to download the source and place it somewhere on your system. Then install Visual Studio and launch the application. 

Go to **File** -> **Open** -> **Folder**.

<br />

<div align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/Aetherinox/ntfy-desktop/assets/118329232/9f91613f-5104-4c30-a623-5ea632a12ed9" width="630">

</div>

<br />

Select the folder where you downloaded ntfy-toast and open it. After a few moments, a few new folders will be created in your project directory:

- üìÅ .vs
- üìÅ out

<br />

You can now start writing your code. Once you are finished, you need to build the application in Visual Studio.

<br />
